## Abstract

Recent theoretical work proposes that gravity may emerge not from intrinsic space-time curvature, but from gradients in quantum informational entropy. One such approach, advanced by Professor Ginestra Bianconi, uses quantum relative entropy to capture the tension between the natural vacuum structure and entropy-modulated states introduced by matter.

This paper reframes that perspective through the lens of **Universal Contradiction Dynamics (UCD)** and **Geometric Lattice Substrates (GLS)**, in which gravitational fields emerge from contradiction gradients within information geometry.

By formalizing contradiction fields and lattice propagation mechanics, I reveal how entropic gravity is a specific case of a broader contradiction-based emergence principle. Further work may formalize a **Contradiction Stress Tensor** `Cμν`, encoding directional contradiction flow across the GLS manifold.
